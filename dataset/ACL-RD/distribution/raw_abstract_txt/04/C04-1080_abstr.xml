    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We present a new HMM tagger that exploits context on both sides of a word to be tagged, and evaluate it in both the unsupervised and supervised case.</S>
    <S>Along the way, we present the first comprehensive comparison of unsupervised methods for part-of-speech tagging, noting that published results to date have not been comparable across corpora or lexicons.</S>
    <S>Observing that the quality of the lexicon greatly impacts the accuracy that can be achieved by the algorithms, we present a method of HMM training that improves accuracy when training of lexical probabilities is unstable.</S>
    <S>Finally, we show how this new tagger achieves state-of-the-art results in a supervised, non-training intensive framework.</S>
