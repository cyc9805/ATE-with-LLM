  <Title>Unsupervised Relation Disambiguation Using Spectral Clustering</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach to disambiguate various relations between named entities by use of various lexical and syntactic features from the contexts.</S>
    <S>It works by calculating eigenvectors of an adjacency graph's Laplacian to recover a submanifold of data from a high dimensionality space and then performing cluster number estimation on the eigenvectors.</S>
    <S>Experiment results on ACE corpora show that this spectral clustering based approach outperforms the other clustering methods.</S>
