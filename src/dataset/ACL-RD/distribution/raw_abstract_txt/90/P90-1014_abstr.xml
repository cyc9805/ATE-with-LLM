    <S>The principle known as free indexation plays an important role in the determination of the referential properties of noun phrases in the principle-and-parameters language framework.</S>
    <S>First, by investigating the combinatorics of free indexation, we show that the problem of enumerating all possible indexings requires exponential time.</S>
    <S>Secondly, we exhibit a provably optimal free indexation algorithm.</S>
