    <S>STRAND (Resnik, 1998) is a language-independent system for automatic discovery of text in parallel translation on the World Wide Web.</S>
    <S>This paper extends the preliminary STRAND results by adding automatic language identification, scaling up by orders of magnitude, and formally evaluating performance.</S>
    <S>The most recent end-product is an automatically acquired parallel corpus comprising 2491 English-French document pairs, approximately 1.5 million words per language.</S>
