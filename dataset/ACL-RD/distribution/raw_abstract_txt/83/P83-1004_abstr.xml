    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Metagrammatical formalisms that combine context-free phrase structure rules and metarules (MPS grammars) allow concise statement of generalizations about the syntax of natural languages.</S>
    <S>Unconstrained MPS grammars, unfortunately, are not computationally safe.</S>
    <S>We evaluate several proposals for constraining them, basing our assessment on computational tractability and explanatory adequacy.</S>
    <S>We show that none of them satisfies both criteria, and suggest new directions for research on alternative metagrammatical formalisms.</S>
