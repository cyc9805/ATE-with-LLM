  <Title>Tagging French - comparing a statistical and a constraint-based method</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper we compare two competing approaches to part-of-speech tagging, statistical and constraint-based disambiguation, using French as our test language.</S>
    <S>We imposed a time limit on our experiment: the amount of time spent on the design of our constraint system was about the same as the time we used to train and test the easy-to-implement statistical model.</S>
    <S>We describe the two systems and compare the results.</S>
    <S>The accuracy of the statistical method is reasonably good, comparable to taggers for English.</S>
    <S>But the constraint-based tagger seems to be superior even with the limited time we allowed ourselves for rule development.</S>
