Content of this folder:

anno1 = tokenised XML for annotator 1
anno2 = tokenised XML for annotator 2 +
		folder indexes: term indexes for tokenised files
unified = XML containing common term annotations for both annotators
statistics.txt = The semantic class assigned to each annotated term by annotator 1 (second column) and 2 (third column). "None" indicates that the term was not annotated by this annotator.
analysis.xlsx = A simple analysis of the class distributions in statistics.txt

Note that the unified files also contain annotations from annotator 1 that are not matched by annotator 2. This, however, is ok insofar, as annotator 1, in general, annotated much more than annotator 2.
