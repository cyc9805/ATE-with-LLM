    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>An empirical comparison of CFG filtering techniques for LTAG and HPSG is presented.</S>
    <S>We demonstrate that an approximation of HPSG produces a more effective CFG filter than that of LTAG.</S>
    <S>We also investigate the reason for that difference.</S>
