    <S>The applicability of many current information extraction techniques is severely limited by the need for supervised training data.</S>
    <S>We demonstrate that for certain field structured extraction tasks, such as classified advertisements and bibliographic citations, small amounts of prior knowledge can be used to learn effective models in a primarily unsupervised fashion.</S>
    <S>Although hidden Markov models (HMMs) provide a suitable generative model for field structured text, general unsupervised HMM learning fails to learn useful structure in either of our domains.</S>
    <S>However, one can dramatically improve the quality of the learned structure by exploiting simple prior knowledge of the desired solutions.</S>
    <S>In both domains, we found that unsupervised methods can attain accuracies with 400 unlabeled examples comparable to those attained by supervised methods on 50 labeled examples, and that semi-supervised methods can make good use of small amounts of labeled data.</S>
