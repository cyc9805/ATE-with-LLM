    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We present results on addressee identification in four-participants face-to-face meetings using Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes classifiers.</S>
    <S>First, we investigate how well the addressee of a dialogue act can be predicted based on gaze, utterance and conversational context features.</S>
    <S>Then, we explore whether information about meeting context can aid classifiers' performances.</S>
    <S>Both classifiers perform the best when conversational context and utterance features are combined with speaker's gaze information.</S>
    <S>The classifiers show little gain from information about meeting context.</S>
