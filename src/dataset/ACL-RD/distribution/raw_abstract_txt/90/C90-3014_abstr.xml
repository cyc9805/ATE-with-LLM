  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper describes the framework of a Korean phonological knowledge base system using the unification-based grammar formalism: Korean Phonology Structure Grammar (KPSG).</S>
    <S>The approach of KPSG provides an explicit development model for constructing a computational phonological system: speech recognition and synthesis system.</S>
    <S>We show that the proposed approach is more describable than other approaches such as those employing a traditional generative phonological approach.</S>
