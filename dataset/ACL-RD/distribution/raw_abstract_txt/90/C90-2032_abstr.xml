    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper proposes document oriented preference sets(DoPS) for the disambiguation of the dependency structure of sentences.</S>
    <S>The DoPS system extracts preference knowledge from a target document or other documents automatically.</S>
    <S>Sentence ambiguities can be resolved by using domain targeted preference knowledge without using complicated large knowledgebases.</S>
    <S>Implementation and empirical results are described for the the analysis of dependency structures of Japanese patent claim sentences.</S>
