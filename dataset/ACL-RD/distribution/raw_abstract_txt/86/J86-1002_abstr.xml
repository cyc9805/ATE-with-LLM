  <Section>
    <SectionTitle></SectionTitle>
    <S>A method for error correction of ill-formed input is described that acquires dialogue patterns in typical usage and uses these patterns to predict new inputs.</S>
    <S>Error correction is done by strongly biasing parsing toward expected meanings unless clear evidence from the input shows the current sentence is not expected.</S>
    <S>A dialogue acquisition and tracking algorithm is presented along with a description of its implementation in a voice interactive system.</S>
    <S>A series of tests are described that show the power of the error correction methodology when stereotypic dialogue occurs.</S>
