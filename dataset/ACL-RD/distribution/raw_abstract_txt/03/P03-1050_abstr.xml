  <Title>Unsupervised Learning of Arabic Stemming using a Parallel Corpus</Title>

    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach to building a non-English (Arabic) stemmer.</S>
    <S>The stemming model is based on statistical machine translation and it uses an English stemmer and a small (10K sentences) parallel corpus as its sole training resources.</S>
    <S>No parallel text is needed after the training phase.</S>
    <S>Monolingual, unannotated text can be used to further improve the stemmer by allowing it to adapt to a desired domain or genre.</S>
    <S>Examples and results will be given for Arabic, but the approach is applicable to any language that needs affix removal.</S>
    <S>Our resource-frugal approach results in 87.5% agreement with a state of the art, proprietary Arabic stemmer built using rules, affix lists, and human annotated text, in addition to an unsupervised component.</S>
    <S>Task-based evaluation using Arabic information retrieval indicates an improvement of 22-38% in average precision over unstemmed text, and 96% of the performance of the proprietary stemmer above.</S>
