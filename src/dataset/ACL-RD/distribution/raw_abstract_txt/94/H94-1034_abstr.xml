    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper describes a method of detecting speech repairs that uses a part-of-speech tagger.</S>
    <S>The tagger is given knowledge about category transitions for speech repairs, and so is able to mark a transition either as a likely repair or as fluent speech.</S>
    <S>Other contextual clues, such as editing terms, word fragments, and word matchings, are also factored in by modifying the transition probabilities.</S>
