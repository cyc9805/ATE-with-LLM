    <S>Spelling-checkers have become an integral part of most text processing software.</S>
    <S>From different reasons among which the speed of processing prevails they are usually based on dictionaries of word forms instead of words.</S>
    <S>This approach is sufficient for languages with little inflection such as English, but fails for highly inflective languages such as Czech, Russian, Slovak or other Slavonic languages.</S>
    <S>We have developed a special method for describing inflection for the purpose of building spelling-checkers for such languages.</S>
    <S>The speed of the resulting program lies somewhere in the middle of the scale of existing spelling-checkers for English and the main dictionary fits into the standard 360K floppy, whereas the number of recognized word forms exceeds 6 million (for Czech).</S>
    <S>Further, a special method has been developed for easy word classification.</S>
