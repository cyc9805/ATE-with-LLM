  <Title>Interactively Exploring a Machine Translation Model</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper describes a method of interactively visualizing and directing the process of translating a sentence.</S>
    <S>The method allows a user to explore a model of syntax-based statistical machine translation (MT), to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses, and to compare it to other MT systems.</S>
    <S>Using this visualization method, we can find and address conceptual and practical problems in an MT system.</S>
    <S>In our demonstration at ACL, new users of our tool will drive a syntax-based decoder for themselves.</S>
