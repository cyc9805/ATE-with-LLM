    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We directly investigate a subject of much recent debate: do word sense disambigation models help statistical machine translation quality?</S>
    <S>We present empirical results casting doubt on this common, but unproved, assumption.</S>
    <S>Using a state-of-the-art Chinese word sense disambiguation model to choose translation candidates for a typical IBM statistical MT system, we find that word sense disambiguation does not yield significantly better translation quality than the statistical machine translation system alone.</S>
    <S>Error analysis suggests several key factors behind this surprising finding, including inherent limitations of current statistical MT architectures.</S>
