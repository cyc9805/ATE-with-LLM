  <Title>What to do when lexicalization fails: parsing German with suffix analysis and smoothing</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper, we present an unlexicalized parser for German which employs smoothing and suffix analysis to achieve a labelled bracket F-score of 76.2, higher than previously reported results on the NEGRA corpus.</S>
    <S>In addition to the high accuracy of the model, the use of smoothing in an unlexicalized parser allows us to better examine the interplay between smoothing and parsing results.</S>
