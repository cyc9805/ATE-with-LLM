  <Title>PATH-BASED AND NODE-BASED INFERENCE IN SEMANTIC NETWORKS</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Two styles of performing inference in semantic networks are presented and compared.</S>
    <S>Path-based inference allows an arc or a path of arcs between two given nodes to be inferred from the existence of another specified path between the same two nodes.</S>
    <S>Path-based inference rules may be written using a binary relational calculus notation.</S>
    <S>Node-based inference allows a structure of nodes to be inferred from the existence of an instance of a pattern of node structures.</S>
    <S>Node-based inference rules can be constructed in a semantic network using a variant of a predicate calculus notation.</S>
    <S>Path-based inference is more efficient, while node-based inference is more general.</S>
    <S>A method is described of combining the two styles in a single system in order to take advantage of the strengths of each.</S>
    <S>Applications of path-based inference rules to the representation of the extensional equivalence of intensional concepts, and to the explication of inheritance in hierarchies are sketched.</S>
