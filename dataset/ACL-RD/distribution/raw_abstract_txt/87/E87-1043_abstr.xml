  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>The verb forms are often claimed to convey two kinds of information : 1. whether the event described in a sentence is present, past or future (= deictic information) 2. whether the event described in a sentence is presented as completed, going on, just starting or being finished (= aspectual information).</S>
    <S>It will be demonstrated in this paper that one has to add a third component to the analysis of verb form meanings, namely whether or not they express habituality.</S>
    <S>The framework of the analysis is model-theoretic semantics.</S>
