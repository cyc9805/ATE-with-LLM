    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>State-of-the-art Question Answering (QA) systems are very sensitive to variations in the phrasing of an information need.</S>
    <S>Finding the preferred language for such a need is a valuable task.</S>
    <S>We investigate that claim by adopting a simple MT-based paraphrasing technique and evaluating QA system performance on paraphrased questions.</S>
    <S>We found a potential increase of 35% in MRR with respect to the original question.</S>
