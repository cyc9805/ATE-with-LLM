  <Title>CONCURRENT LEXICAIJZEID DEPENDENCY PARSING: THE ParseTalk MODEL</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>A grammar model for concurrent, object-oriented natural language parsing is introduced.</S>
    <S>Complete lexical distribution of grammatical knowledge is achieved building upon the head-oriented notions of valency and dependency, while inheritance mechanisms are used to capture lexical generalizations.</S>
    <S>The underlying concurrent computation model relies upon the actor paradigm.</S>
    <S>We consider message passing protocols for establishing dependency relations and ambiguity handling.</S>
