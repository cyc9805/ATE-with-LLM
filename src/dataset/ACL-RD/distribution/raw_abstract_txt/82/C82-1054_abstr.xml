  <Section>
    <SectionTitle></SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper proposes a series of modifications to the left corner parsing algorithm for context-free grammars.</S>
    <S>It is argued that the resulting algorithm is both efficient and flexible and is, therefore, a good choice for the parser used in a natural language interface.</S>
