  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>There are several approaches that model information extraction as a token classification task, using various tagging strategies to combine multiple tokens.</S>
    <S>We describe the tagging strategies that can be found in the literature and evaluate their relative performances.</S>
    <S>We also introduce a new strategy, called Begin/After tagging or BIA, and show that it is competitive to the best other strategies.</S>
