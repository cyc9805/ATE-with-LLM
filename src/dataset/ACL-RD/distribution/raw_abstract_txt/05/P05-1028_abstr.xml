    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper presents a corpus study that explores the extent to which captions contribute to recognizing the intended message of an information graphic.</S>
    <S>It then presents an implemented graphic interpretation system that takes into account a variety of communicative signals, and an evaluation study showing that evidence obtained from shallow processing of the graphic's caption has a significant impact on the system's success.</S>
    <S>This work is part of a larger project whose goal is to provide sight-impaired users with effective access to information graphics.</S>
