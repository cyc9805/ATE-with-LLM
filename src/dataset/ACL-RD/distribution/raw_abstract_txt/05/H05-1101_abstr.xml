  <Title>Some Computational Complexity Results for Synchronous Context-Free Grammars</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper investigates some computational problems associated with probabilistic translation models that have recently been adopted in the literature on machine translation.</S>
    <S>These models can be viewed as pairs of probabilistic context-free grammars working in a 'synchronous' way.</S>
    <S>Two hardness results for the class NP are reported, along with an exponential time lower-bound for certain classes of algorithms that are currently used in the literature.</S>
