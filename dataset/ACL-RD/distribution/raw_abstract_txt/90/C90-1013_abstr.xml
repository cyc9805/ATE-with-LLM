  <Title>Generation for Dialogue Translation Using Typed Feature Structure Unification</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This article introduces a bidirectional grammar generation system called feature structure-directed generation, developed for a dialogue translation system.</S>
    <S>The system utilizes typed feature structures to control the top-down derivation in a declarative way.</S>
    <S>This generation system also uses disjunctive feature structures to reduce the number of copies of the derivation tree.</S>
    <S>The grammar for this generator is designed to properly generate the speaker's intention in a telephone dialogue.</S>
