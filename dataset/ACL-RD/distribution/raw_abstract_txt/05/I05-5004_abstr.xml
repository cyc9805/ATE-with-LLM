  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Towards deep analysis of compositional classes of paraphrases, we have examined a class-oriented framework for collecting paraphrase examples, in which sentential paraphrases are collected for each paraphrase class separately by means of automatic candidate generation and manual judgement.</S>
    <S>Our preliminary experiments on building a paraphrase corpus have so far been producing promising results, which we have evaluated according to cost-efficiency, exhaustiveness, and reliability.</S>
