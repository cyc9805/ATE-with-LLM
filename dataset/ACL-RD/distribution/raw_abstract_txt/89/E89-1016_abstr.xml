    <S>This paper presents a critical discussion of the various approaches that have been used in the evaluation of Natural Language systems.</S>
    <S>We conclude that previous approaches have neglected to evaluate systems in the context of their use, e.g. solving a task requiring data retrieval.</S>
    <S>This raises questions about the validity of such approaches.</S>
    <S>In the second half of the paper, we report a laboratory study using the Wizard of Oz technique to identify NL requirements for carrying out this task.</S>
    <S>We evaluate the demands that task dialogues collected using this technique, place upon a prototype Natural Language system.</S>
    <S>We identify three important requirements which arose from the task that we gave our subjects: operators specific to the task of database access, complex contextual reference and reference to the structure of the information source.</S>
    <S>We discuss how these might be satisfied by future Natural Language systems.</S>
