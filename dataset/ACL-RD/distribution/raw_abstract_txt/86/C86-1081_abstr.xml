  <Title>A LOGICAL FORMALISM FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF DETERMINERS</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>Determiners play an important role in conveying the meaning of an utterance, but they have often been disregarded, perhaps because it seemed more important to devise methods to grasp the global meaning of a sentence, even if not in a precise way.</S>
    <S>Another problem with determiners is their inherent ambiguity.</S>
    <S>In this paper we propose a logical formalism, which, among other things, is suitable for representing determiners without forcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is still not clear.</S>
