  <Title>A CSR-NL INTERFACE SPECIFICATION: Version 1.5</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>Spoken Language Systems will require integration of continuous speech recognition and natural language processing.</S>
    <S>This is a proposed specification for an interface between a continuous speech recognizer (CSR) and a natural language processor (NLP) to form a spoken language system.</S>
    <S>Both components are integrated with a stack controller and contribute to the search control.</S>
    <S>The specification also defines a Top-N mode in which a first part outputs a list of top N scored sentences for postprocessing by a second part.</S>
    <S>An additional use for this specification might be NLP evaluation testing: a common simulated CSR could be interfaced to each site's NLP to provide identical testing environments.</S>
