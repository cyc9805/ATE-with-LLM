    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We present a statistical model of Japanese unknown words consisting of a set of length and spelling models classified by the character types that constitute a word.</S>
    <S>The point is quite simple: different character sets should be treated differently and the changes between character types are very important because Japanese script has both ideograms like Chinese (kanji) and phonograms like English (katakana).</S>
    <S>Both word segmentation accuracy and part of speech tagging accuracy are improved by the proposed model.</S>
    <S>The model can achieve 96.6% tagging accuracy if unknown words are correctly segmented.</S>
