    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Motivated by the success of ensemble methods in machine learning and other areas of natural language processing, we developed a multi-strategy and multi-source approach to question answering which is based on combining the results from different answering agents searching for answers in multiple corpora.</S>
    <S>The answering agents adopt fundamentally different strategies, one utilizing primarily knowledge-based mechanisms and the other adopting statistical techniques.</S>
    <S>We present our multi-level answer resolution algorithm that combines results from the answering agents at the question, passage, and/or answer levels.</S>
    <S>Experiments evaluating the effectiveness of our answer resolution algorithm show a 35.0% relative improvement over our baseline system in the number of questions correctly answered, and a 32.8% improvement according to the average precision metric.</S>
