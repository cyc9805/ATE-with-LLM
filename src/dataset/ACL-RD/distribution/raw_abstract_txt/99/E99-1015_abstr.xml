    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In order to build robust automatic abstracting systems, there is a need for better training resources than are currently available.</S>
    <S>In this paper, we introduce an annotation scheme for scientific articles which can be used to build such a resource in a consistent way.</S>
    <S>The seven categories of the scheme are based on rhetorical moves of argumentation.</S>
    <S>Our experimental results show that the scheme is stable, reproducible and intuitive to use.</S>
