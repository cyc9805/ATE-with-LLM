  <Title>Using Predicate-Argument Structures for Information Extraction</Title>

    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper we present a novel, customizable IE paradigm that takes advantage of predicate-argument structures.</S>
    <S>We also introduce a new way of automatically identifying predicate argument structures, which is central to our IE paradigm.</S>
    <S>It is based on: (1) an extended set of features; and (2) inductive decision tree learning.</S>
    <S>The experimental results prove our claim that accurate predicate-argument structures enable high quality IE results.</S>
