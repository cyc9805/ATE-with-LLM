  <Title>Island Parsing and Bidirectional Charts</Title>

    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Chart parsing is directional in the sense that it works from the starting point (usually the beginning of the sentence) extending its activity usually in a rightward manner.</S>
    <S>We shall introduce the concept of a chart that works outward from islands and makes sense of as much of the sentence as it is actually possible, and after that will lead to predictions of missing fragments.</S>
    <S>So, for any place where the easily identifiable fragments occur in the sentence, the process will extend to both the left and the right of the islands, until possibly completely missing fragments are reached.</S>
    <S>At that point, by virtue of the fact that both a left and a right context were found, heuristics can be introduced that predict the nature of the missing fragments.</S>
