  <Title>A Construction-Specific Approach to Focused Interaction in Flexible Parsing</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>A flexible parser can deal with input that deviates from its grammar, in addition to input that conforms to it.</S>
    <S>Ideally, such a parser will correct the deviant input: sometimes, it will be unable to correct it at all; at other times, correction will be possible, but only to within a range of ambiguous possibilities.</S>
    <S>This paper is concerned with such ambiguous situations, and with making it as easy as possible for the ambiguity to be resolved through consultation with the user of the parser - we presume interactive use.</S>
    <S>We show the importance of asking the user for clarification in as focused a way as possible.</S>
    <S>Focused interaction of this kind is facilitated by a construction-specific approach to flexible parsing, with specialized parsing techniques for each type of construction, and specialized ambiguity representations for each type of ambiguity that a particular construction can give rise to.</S>
    <S>A construction-specific approach also aids in task-specific language development by allowing a language definition that is natural in terms of the task domain to be interpreted directly without compilation into a uniform grammar formalism, thus greatly speeding the testing of changes to the language definition.</S>
