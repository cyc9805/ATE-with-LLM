    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Conversationally relevant descriptions are definite descriptions that are not merely tools for the identification of a referent, but are also crucial to the discourse in other respects.</S>
    <S>I analyze the uses of such descriptions in assertions as conveying a particular type of conversational implicatures.</S>
    <S>Such implicatures can be represented within the framework of possible world semantics.</S>
    <S>The analysis is extended to non-assertive illocutionary acts on the one hand, and to indefinite descriptions on the other.</S>
