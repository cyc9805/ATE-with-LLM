  <Title>Metaphor - A Key to Extensible Semantic Analysis</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Interpreting metaphors is an integral and inescapable process in human understanding of natural language.</S>
    <S>This paper discusses a method of analyzing metaphors based on the existence of a small number of generalized metaphor mappings.</S>
    <S>Each generalized metaphor contains a recognition network, a basic mapping, additional transfer mappings, and an implicit intention component.</S>
    <S>It is argued that the method reduces metaphor interpretation from a reconstruction to a recognition task.</S>
    <S>Implications towards automating certain aspects of language learning are also discussed.</S>
