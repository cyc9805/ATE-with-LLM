  <Title>SPoT: A Trainable Sentence Planner</Title>

    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Sentence planning is a set of inter-related but distinct tasks, one of which is sentence scoping, i.e. the choice of syntactic structure for elementary speech acts and the decision of how to combine them into one or more sentences.</S>
    <S>In this paper, we present SPoT, a sentence planner, and a new methodology for automatically training SPoT on the basis of feedback provided by human judges.</S>
    <S>We reconceptualize the task into two distinct phases.</S>
    <S>First, a very simple, randomized sentence-plan-generator (SPG) generates a potentially large list of possible sentence plans for a given text-plan input.</S>
    <S>Second, the sentence-plan-ranker (SPR) ranks the list of output sentence plans, and then selects the top-ranked plan.</S>
    <S>The SPR uses ranking rules automatically learned from training data.</S>
    <S>We show that the trained SPR learns to select a sentence plan whose rating on average is only 5% worse than the top human-ranked sentence plan.</S>
