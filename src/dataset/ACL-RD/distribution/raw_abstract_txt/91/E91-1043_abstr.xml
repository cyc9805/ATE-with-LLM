  <Title>A BIDIRECTIONAL MODEL FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper I will argue for a model of grammatical processing that is based on uniform processing and knowledge sources.</S>
    <S>The main feature of this model is to view parsing and generation as two strongly interleaved tasks performed by a single parametrized deduction process.</S>
    <S>It will be shown that this view supports flexible and efficient natural language processing.</S>
