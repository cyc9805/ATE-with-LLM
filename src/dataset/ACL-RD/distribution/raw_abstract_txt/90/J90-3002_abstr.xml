    <S>This paper presents a specialized editor for a highly structured dictionary.</S>
    <S>The basic goal in building that editor was to provide an adequate tool to help lexicologists produce a valid and coherent dictionary on the basis of a linguistic theory.</S>
    <S>If we want valuable lexicons and grammars to achieve complex natural language processing, we must provide very powerful tools to help create and ensure the validity of such complex linguistic databases.</S>
    <S>Our most important task in building the editor was to define a set of coherence rules that could be computationally applied to ensure the validity of lexical entries.</S>
    <S>A customized interface for browsing and editing was also designed and implemented.</S>
