    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>While paraphrasing is critical both for interpretation and generation of natural language, current systems use manual or semi-automatic methods to collect paraphrases.</S>
    <S>We present an unsupervised learning algorithm for identification of paraphrases from a corpus of multiple English translations of the same source text.</S>
    <S>Our approach yields phrasal and single word lexical paraphrases as well as syntactic paraphrases.</S>
