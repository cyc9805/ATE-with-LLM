  <Title>On Combining Language Models : Oracle Approach</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper, we address the problem of combining several language models (LMs).</S>
    <S>We find that simple interpolation methods, like log-linear and linear interpolation, improve the performance but fall short of the performance of an oracle.</S>
    <S>The oracle knows the reference word string and selects the word string with the best performance (typically, word or semantic error rate) from a list of word strings, where each word string has been obtained by using a different LM.</S>
    <S>Actually, the oracle acts like a dynamic combiner with hard decisions using the reference.</S>
    <S>We provide experimental results that clearly show the need for a dynamic language model combination to improve the performance further.</S>
    <S>We suggest a method that mimics the behavior of the oracle using a neural network or a decision tree.</S>
    <S>The method amounts to tagging LMs with confidence measures and picking the best hypothesis corresponding to the LM with the best confidence.</S>
