    <S>In this paper we study a set of problems that are of considerable importance to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) but which have not been addressed satisfactorily by the SMT research community.</S>
    <S>Over the last decade, a variety of SMT algorithms have been built and empirically tested whereas little is known about the computational complexity of some of the fundamental problems of SMT.</S>
    <S>Our work aims at providing useful insights into the the computational complexity of those problems.</S>
    <S>We prove that while IBM Models 1-2 are conceptually and computationally simple, computations involving the higher (and more useful) models are hard.</S>
    <S>Since it is unlikely that there exists a polynomial time solution for any of these hard problems (unless P = NP and P#P = P), our results highlight and justify the need for developing polynomial time approximations for these computations.</S>
    <S>We also discuss some practical ways of dealing with complexity.</S>
