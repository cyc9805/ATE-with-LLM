  <Title>Construct Algebra: Analytical Dialog Management</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper we describe a systematic approach for creating a dialog management system based on a Construct Algebra, a collection of relations and operations on a task representation.</S>
    <S>These relations and operations are analytical components for building higher level abstractions called dialog motivators.</S>
    <S>The dialog manager, consisting of a collection of dialog motivators, is entirely built using the Construct Algebra.</S>
