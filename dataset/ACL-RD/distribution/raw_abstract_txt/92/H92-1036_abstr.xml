  <Title>MAP Estimation of Continuous Density HMM: Theory and Applications</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>We discuss maximum a posteriori estimation of continuous density hidden Markov models (CDHMM).</S>
    <S>The classical MLE reestimation algorithms, namely the forward-backward algorithm and the segmental k-means algorithm, are expanded and reestimation formulas are given for HMM with Gaussian mixture observation densities.</S>
    <S>Because of its adaptive nature, Bayesian learning serves as a unified approach for the following four speech recognition applications, namely parameter smoothing, speaker adaptation, speaker group modeling and corrective training.</S>
    <S>New experimental results on all four applications are provided to show the effectiveness of the MAP estimation approach.</S>
