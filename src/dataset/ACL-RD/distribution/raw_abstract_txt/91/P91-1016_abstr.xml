    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>A system is described for acquiring a context-sensitive, phrase structure grammar which is applied by a best-path, bottom-up, deterministic parser.</S>
    <S>The grammar was based on English news stories and a high degree of success in parsing is reported.</S>
    <S>Overall, this research concludes that CSG is a computationally and conceptually tractable approach to the construction of phrase structure grammar for news story text.</S>
