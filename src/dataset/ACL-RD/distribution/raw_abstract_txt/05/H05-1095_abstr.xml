    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper presents a phrase-based statistical machine translation method, based on non-contiguous phrases, i.e. phrases with gaps.</S>
    <S>A method for producing such phrases from a word-aligned corpora is proposed.</S>
    <S>A statistical translation model is also presented that deals such phrases, as well as a training method based on the maximization of translation accuracy, as measured with the NIST evaluation metric.</S>
    <S>Translations are produced by means of a beam-search decoder.</S>
    <S>Experimental results are presented, that demonstrate how the proposed method allows to better generalize from the training data.</S>
