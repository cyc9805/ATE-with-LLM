  <Title>CONCURRENT LEXICALIZED DEPENDENCY PARSING: A BEHAVIORAL VIEW ON ParseTalk EVENTS</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>The behavioral specification of an object-oriented grammar model is considered.</S>
    <S>The model is based on full lexicalization, head-orientation via valency constraints and dependency relations, inheritance as a means for non-redundant lexicon specification, and concurrency of computation.</S>
    <S>The computation model relies upon the actor paradigm, with concurrency entering through asynchronous message passing between actors.</S>
    <S>In particular, we here elaborate on principles of how the global behavior of a lexically distributed grammar and its corresponding parser can be specified in terms of event type networks and event networks, resp.</S>
