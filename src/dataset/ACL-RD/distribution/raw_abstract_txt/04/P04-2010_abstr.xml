  <Title>A Machine Learning Approach to German Pronoun Resolution</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper presents a novel ensemble learning approach to resolving German pronouns.</S>
    <S>Boosting, the method in question, combines the moderately accurate hypotheses of several classifiers to form a highly accurate one.</S>
    <S>Experiments show that this approach is superior to a single decision-tree classifier.</S>
    <S>Furthermore, we present a standalone system that resolves pronouns in unannotated text by using a fully automatic sequence of preprocessing modules that mimics the manual annotation process.</S>
    <S>Although the system performs well within a limited textual domain, further research is needed to make it effective for open-domain question answering and text summarisation.</S>
