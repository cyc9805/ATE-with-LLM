  <Title>A PRAGMATICS-BASED APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING INTERSENTENTIAL ELLIPSIS</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>Intersentential elliptical utterances occur frequently in information-seeking dialogues.</S>
    <S>This paper presents a pragmatics-based framework for interpreting such utterances, including identification of the speaker' s discourse goal in employing the fragment.</S>
    <S>We claim that the advantage of this approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information, including discourse content and conversational goals, rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterance alone.</S>
