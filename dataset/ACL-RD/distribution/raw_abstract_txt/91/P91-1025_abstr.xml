  <Title>Resolving Translation Mismatches With Information Flow</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>Languages differ in the concepts and real-world entities for which they have words and grammatical constructs.</S>
    <S>Therefore translation must sometimes be a matter of approximating the meaning of a source language text rather than finding an exact counterpart in the target language.</S>
    <S>We propose a translation framework based on Situation Theory.</S>
    <S>The basic ingredients are an information lattice, a representation scheme for utterances embedded in contexts, and a mismatch resolution scheme defined in terms of information flow.</S>
    <S>We motivate our approach with examples of translation between English and Japanese.</S>
