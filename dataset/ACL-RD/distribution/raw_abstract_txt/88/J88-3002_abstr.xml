    <S>For intelligent interactive systems to communicate with humans in a natural manner, they must have knowledge about the system users.</S>
    <S>This paper explores the role of user modeling in such systems.</S>
    <S>It begins with a characterization of what a user model is and how it can be used.</S>
    <S>The types of information that a user model may be required to keep about a user are then identified and discussed.</S>
    <S>User models themselves can vary greatly depending on the requirements of the situation and the implementation, so several dimensions along which they can be classified are presented.</S>
    <S>Since acquiring the knowledge for a user model is a fundamental problem in user modeling, a section is devoted to this topic.</S>
    <S>Next, the benefits and costs of implementing a user modeling component for a system are weighed in light of several aspects of the interaction requirements that may be imposed by the system.</S>
    <S>Finally, the current state of research in user modeling is summarized, and future research topics that must be addressed in order to achieve powerful, general user modeling systems are assessed.</S>
