    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Link detection has been regarded as a core technology for the Topic Detection and Tracking tasks of new event detection.</S>
    <S>In this paper we formulate story link detection and new event detection as information retrieval task and hypothesize on the impact of precision and recall on both systems.</S>
    <S>Motivated by these arguments, we introduce a number of new performance enhancing techniques including part of speech tagging, new similarity measures and expanded stop lists.</S>
    <S>Experimental results validate our hypothesis.</S>
