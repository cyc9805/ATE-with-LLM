  <Title>Clustering Polysemic Subcategorization Frame Distributions Semantically</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Previous research has demonstrated the utility of clustering in inducing semantic verb classes from undisambiguated corpus data.</S>
    <S>We describe a new approach which involves clustering subcategorization frame (SCF) distributions using the Information Bottleneck and nearest neighbour methods.</S>
    <S>In contrast to previous work, we particularly focus on clustering polysemic verbs.</S>
    <S>A novel evaluation scheme is proposed which accounts for the effect of polysemy on the clusters, offering us a good insight into the potential and limitations of semantically classifying undisambiguated SCF data.</S>
