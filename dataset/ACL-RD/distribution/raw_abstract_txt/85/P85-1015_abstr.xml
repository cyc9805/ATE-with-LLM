    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>By generalizing the notion of location of a constituent to allow discontinuous locations, one can describe the discontinuous constituents of non-configurational languages.</S>
    <S>These discontinuous constituents can be described by a variant of definite clause grammars, and these grammars can be used in conjunction with a proof procedure to create a parser for non-configurational languages.</S>
