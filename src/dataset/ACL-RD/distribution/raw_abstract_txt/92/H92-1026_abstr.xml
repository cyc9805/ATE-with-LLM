  <Title>Towards History-based Grammars: Using Richer Models for Probabilistic Parsing</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>We describe a generative probabilistic model of natural language, which we call HBG, that takes advantage of detailed linguistic information to resolve ambiguity.</S>
    <S>HBG incorporates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way.</S>
    <S>We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Treebank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence.</S>
    <S>This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection in the hope of generating the correct parse.</S>
    <S>In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabilistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error.</S>
