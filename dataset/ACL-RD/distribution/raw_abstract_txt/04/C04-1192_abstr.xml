    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>The paper presents a method for word sense disambiguation based on parallel corpora.</S>
    <S>The method exploits recent advances in word alignment and word clustering based on automatic extraction of translation equivalents and being supported by available aligned wordnets for the languages in the corpus.</S>
    <S>The wordnets are aligned to the Princeton Wordnet, according to the principles established by EuroWordNet.</S>
    <S>The evaluation of the WSD system, implementing the method described herein showed very encouraging results.</S>
    <S>The same system used in a validation mode, can be used to check and spot alignment errors in multilingually aligned wordnets as BalkaNet and EuroWordNet.</S>
