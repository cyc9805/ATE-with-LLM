    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Despite much recent progress on accurate semantic role labeling, previous work has largely used independent classifiers, possibly combined with separate label sequence models via Viterbi decoding.</S>
    <S>This stands in stark contrast to the linguistic observation that a core argument frame is a joint structure, with strong dependencies between arguments.</S>
    <S>We show how to build a joint model of argument frames, incorporating novel features that model these interactions into discriminative log-linear models.</S>
    <S>This system achieves an error reduction of 22% on all arguments and 32% on core arguments over a state-of-the art independent classifier for gold-standard parse trees on PropBank.</S>
