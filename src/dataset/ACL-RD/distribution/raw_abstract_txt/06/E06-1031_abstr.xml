    <S>Most state-of-the-art evaluation measures for machine translation assign high costs to movements of word blocks.</S>
    <S>In many cases though such movements still result in correct or almost correct sentences.</S>
    <S>In this paper, we will present a new evaluation measure which explicitly models block reordering as an edit operation.</S>
    <S>Our measure can be exactly calculated in quadratic time.</S>
    <S>Furthermore, we will show how some evaluation measures can be improved by the introduction of word-dependent substitution costs.</S>
    <S>The correlation of the new measure with human judgment has been investigated systematically on two different language pairs.</S>
    <S>The experimental results will show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in sentence-level correlation.</S>
    <S>Results from experiments with word dependent substitution costs will demonstrate an additional increase of correlation between automatic evaluation measures and human judgment.</S>
