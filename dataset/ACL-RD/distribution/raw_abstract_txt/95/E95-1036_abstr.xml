  <Title>Splitting the Reference Time: Temporal Anaphora and Quantification in DRT</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper presents an analysis of temporal anaphora in sentences which contain quantification over events, within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory.</S>
    <S>The analysis in (Partee, 1984) of quantified sentences, introduced by a temporal connective, gives the wrong truth-conditions when the temporal connective in the subordinate clause is before or after.</S>
    <S>This problem has been previously analyzed in (de Swart, 1991) as an instance of the proportion problem, and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach.</S>
    <S>By using a careful distinction between the different notions of reference time, based on (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), we propose a solution to this problem, within the framework of DRT.</S>
    <S>We show some applications of this solution to additional temporal anaphora phenomena in quantified sentences.</S>
