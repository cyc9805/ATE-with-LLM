    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We present a syntax-based constraint for word alignment, known as the cohesion constraint.</S>
    <S>It requires disjoint English phrases to be mapped to non-overlapping intervals in the French sentence.</S>
    <S>We evaluate the utility of this constraint in two different algorithms.</S>
    <S>The results show that it can provide a significant improvement in alignment quality.</S>
