  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We describe a computational system which parses discourses consisting of sequences of simple sentences.</S>
    <S>These contain a range of temporal constructions, including time adverbials, progressive aspect and various aspectual classes.</S>
    <S>In particular, the grammar generates the required readings, according to the theoretical analysis of (Glasbey, forthcoming), for sentence-final 'then'.</S>
