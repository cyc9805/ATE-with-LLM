  <Title>Word Sense Induction: Triplet-Based Clustering and Automatic Evaluation</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper a novel solution to automatic and unsupervised word sense induction (WSI) is introduced.</S>
    <S>It represents an instantiation of the one sense per collocation observation (Gale et al., 1992).</S>
    <S>Like most existing approaches it utilizes clustering of word co-occurrences.</S>
    <S>This approach differs from other approaches to WSI in that it enhances the effect of the one sense per collocation observation by using triplets of words instead of pairs.</S>
    <S>The combination with a two-step clustering process using sentence co-occurrences as features allows for accurate results.</S>
    <S>Additionally, a novel and likewise automatic and unsupervised evaluation method inspired by Schutze's (1992) idea of evaluation of word sense disambiguation algorithms is employed.</S>
    <S>Offering advantages like reproducability and independency of a given biased gold standard it also enables automatic parameter optimization of the WSI algorithm.</S>
