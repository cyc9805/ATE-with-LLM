  <Title>Automatic Acquisition of Subcategorization Frames from Tagged Text</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper describes an implemented program that takes a tagged text corpus and generates a partial list of the subcategorization frames in which each verb occurs.</S>
    <S>The completeness of the output list increases monotonically with the total occurrences of each verb in the training corpus.</S>
    <S>False positive rates are one to three percent.</S>
    <S>Five subcategorization frames are currently detected and we foresee no impediment to detecting many more.</S>
    <S>Ultimately, we expect to provide a large subcategorization dictionary to the NLP community and to train dictionaries for specific corpora.</S>
