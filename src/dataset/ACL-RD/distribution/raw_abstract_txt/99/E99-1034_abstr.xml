    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper explores the issue of using different co-occurrence similarities between terms for separating query terms that are useful for retrieval from those that are harmful.</S>
    <S>The hypothesis under examination is that useful terms tend to be more similar to each other than to other query terms.</S>
    <S>Preliminary experiments with similarities computed using first-order and second-order co-occurrence seem to confirm the hypothesis.</S>
    <S>Term similarities could then be used for determining which query terms are useful and best reflect the user's information need.</S>
    <S>A possible application would be to use this source of evidence for tuning the weights of the query terms.</S>
