  <Title>Scaling Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation to Larger Corpora and Longer Phrases</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper we describe a novel data structure for phrase-based statistical machine translation which allows for the retrieval of arbitrarily long phrases while simultaneously using less memory than is required by current decoder implementations.</S>
    <S>We detail the computational complexity and average retrieval times for looking up phrase translations in our suffix array-based data structure.</S>
    <S>We show how sampling can be used to reduce the retrieval time by orders of magnitude with no loss in translation quality.</S>
