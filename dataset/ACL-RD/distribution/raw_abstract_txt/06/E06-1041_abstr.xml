  <Title>Structuring Knowledge for Reference Generation: A Clustering Algorithm</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper discusses two problems that arise in the Generation of Referring Expressions: (a) numeric-valued attributes, such as size or location; (b) perspective-taking in reference.</S>
    <S>Both problems, it is argued, can be resolved if some structure is imposed on the available knowledge prior to content determination.</S>
    <S>We describe a clustering algorithm which is sufficiently general to be applied to these diverse problems, discuss its application, and evaluate its performance.</S>
