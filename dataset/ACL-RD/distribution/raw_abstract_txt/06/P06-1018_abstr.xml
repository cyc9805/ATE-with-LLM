    <S>This paper proposes a generic mathematical formalism for the combination of various structures: strings, trees, dags, graphs, and products of them.</S>
    <S>The polarization of the objects of the elementary structures controls the saturation of the final structure.</S>
    <S>This formalism is both elementary and powerful enough to strongly simulate many grammar formalisms, such as rewriting systems, dependency grammars, TAG, HPSG and LFG.</S>
