  <Title>Large-Scale Acquisition of LCS-Based Lexicons for Foreign Language Tutoring</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We focus on the problem of building large repositories of lexical conceptual structure (LCS) representations for verbs in multiple languages.</S>
    <S>One of the main results of this work is the definition of a relation between broad semantic classes and LCS meaning components.</S>
    <S>Our acquisition program - LEXICALL - takes, as input, the result of previous work on verb classification and thematic grid tagging, and outputs LCS representations for different languages.</S>
    <S>These representations have been ported into English, Arabic and Spanish lexicons, each containing approximately 9000 verbs.</S>
    <S>We are currently using these lexicons in an operational foreign language tutoring and machine translation.</S>
