  <Title>Intelligent Access to Text: Integrating Information Extraction Technology into Text Browsers</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper we show how two standard outputs from information extraction (IE) systems - named entity annotations and scenario templates - can be used to enhance access to text collections via a standard text browser.</S>
    <S>We describe how this information is used in a prototype system designed to support information workers' access to a pharmaceutical news archive as part of their industry watch function.</S>
    <S>We also report results of a preliminary, qualitative user evaluation of the system, which while broadly positive indicates further work needs to be done on the interface to make users aware of the increased potential of IE-enhanced text browsers.</S>
