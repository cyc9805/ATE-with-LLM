    <S>One of the claimed benefits of Tree Adjoining Grammars is that they have an extended domain of locality (EDOL).</S>
    <S>We consider how this can be exploited to limit the need for feature structure unification during parsing.</S>
    <S>We compare two wide-coverage lexicalized grammars of English, LEXSYS and XTAG, finding that the two grammars exploit EDOL in different ways.</S>
