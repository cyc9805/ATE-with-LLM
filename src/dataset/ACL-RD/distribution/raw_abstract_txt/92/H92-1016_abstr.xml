  <Title>The MIT ATIS System: February 1992 Progress Report</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper describes the status of the MIT ATIS system as of February 1992, focusing especially on the changes made to the SUMMIT recognizer.</S>
    <S>These include context-dependent phonetic modelling, the use of a bigram language model in conjunction with a probabilistic LR parser, and refinements made to the lexicon.</S>
    <S>Together with the use of a larger training set, these modifications combined to reduce the speech recognition word and sentence error rates by a factor of 2.5 and 1.6, respectively, on the October '91 test set.</S>
    <S>The weighted error for the entire spoken language system on the same test set is 49.3%.</S>
    <S>Similar results were also obtained on the February '92 benchmark evaluation.</S>
