    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We propose a method that automatically generates paraphrase sets from seed sentences to be used as reference sets in objective machine translation evaluation measures like BLEU and NIST.</S>
    <S>We measured the quality of the paraphrases produced in an experiment, i.e., (i) their grammaticality: at least 99% correct sentences; (ii) their equivalence in meaning: at least 96% correct paraphrases either by meaning equivalence or entailment; and, (iii) the amount of internal lexical and syntactical variation in a set of paraphrases: slightly superior to that of hand-produced sets.</S>
    <S>The paraphrase sets produced by this method thus seem adequate as reference sets to be used for MT evaluation.</S>
