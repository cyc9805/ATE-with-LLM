    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Corpus-based sense disambiguation methods, like most other statistical NLP approaches, suffer from the problem of data sparseness.</S>
    <S>In this paper, we describe an approach which overcomes this problem using dictionary definitions.</S>
    <S>Using the definition-based conceptual co-occurrence data collected from the relatively small Brown corpus, our sense disambiguation system achieves an average accuracy comparable to human performance given the same contextual information.</S>
