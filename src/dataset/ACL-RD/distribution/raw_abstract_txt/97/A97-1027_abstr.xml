    <S>In this paper, we want to show how the morphological component of an existing NLP-system for Dutch (Dutch Medical Language Processor - DMLP) has been extended in order to produce output that is compatible with the language independent modules of the LSP-MLP system (Linguistic String Project - Medical Language Processor) of the New York University.</S>
    <S>The former can take advantage of the language independent developments of the latter, while focusing on idiosyncrasies for Dutch.</S>
    <S>This general strategy will be illustrated by a practical application, namely the highlighting of relevant information in a patient discharge summary (PDS) by means of modern HyperText Mark-Up Language (HTML) technology.</S>
    <S>Such an application can be of use for medical administrative purposes in a hospital environment.</S>
