  <Title>Activity detection for information access to oral communication</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>Oral communication is ubiquitous and carries important information yet it is also time consuming to document.</S>
    <S>Given the development of storage media and networks one could just record and store a conversation for documentation.</S>
    <S>The question is, however, how an interesting information piece would be found in a large database.</S>
    <S>Traditional information retrieval techniques use a histogram of keywords as the document representation but oral communication may offer additional indices such as the time and place of the rejoinder and the attendance.</S>
    <S>An alternative index could be the activity such as discussing, planning, informing, story-telling, etc.</S>
    <S>This paper addresses the problem of the automatic detection of those activities in meeting situation and everyday rejoinders.</S>
    <S>Several extensions of this basic idea are being discussed and/or evaluated: Similar to activities one can define subsets of larger database and detect those automatically which is shown on a large database of TV shows.</S>
    <S>Emotions and other indices such as the dominance distribution of speakers might be available on the surface and could be used directly.</S>
    <S>Despite the small size of the databases used some results about the effectiveness of these indices can be obtained.</S>
