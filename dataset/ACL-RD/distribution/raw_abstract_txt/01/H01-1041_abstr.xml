  <Title>Interlingua-Based Broad-Coverage Korean-to-English Translation in CCLING</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>At MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we have been developing a Korean-to-English machine translation system CCLINC (Common Coalition Language System at Lincoln Laboratory).</S>
    <S>The CCLINC Korean-to-English translation system consists of two core modules, language understanding and generation modules mediated by a language neutral meaning representation called a semantic frame.</S>
    <S>The key features of the system include: (i) Robust efficient parsing of Korean (a verb final language with overt case markers, relatively free word order, and frequent omissions of arguments).</S>
    <S>(ii) High quality translation via word sense disambiguation and accurate word order generation of the target language.</S>
    <S>(iii) Rapid system development and porting to new domains via knowledge-based automated acquisition of grammars.</S>
    <S>Having been trained on Korean newspaper articles on missiles and chemical biological warfare, the system produces the translation output sufficient for content understanding of the original document.</S>
