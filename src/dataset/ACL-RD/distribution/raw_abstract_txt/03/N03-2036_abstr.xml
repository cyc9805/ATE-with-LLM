  <Title>A Phrase-Based Unigram Model for Statistical Machine Translation</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper, we describe a phrase-based unigram model for statistical machine translation that uses a much simpler set of model parameters than similar phrase-based models.</S>
    <S>The units of translation are blocks - pairs of phrases.</S>
    <S>During decoding, we use a block unigram model and a word-based trigram language model.</S>
    <S>During training, the blocks are learned from source interval projections using an underlying word alignment.</S>
    <S>We show experimental results on block selection criteria based on unigram counts and phrase length.</S>
