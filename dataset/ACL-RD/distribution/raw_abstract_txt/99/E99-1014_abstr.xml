  <Title>Full Text Parsing using Cascades of Rules: an Information Extraction Perspective</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper proposes an approach to full parsing suitable for Information Extraction from texts.</S>
    <S>Sequences of cascades of rules deterministically analyze the text, building unambiguous structures.</S>
    <S>Initially basic chunks are analyzed; then argumental relations are recognized; finally modifier attachment is performed and the global parse tree is built.</S>
    <S>The approach was proven to work for three languages and different domains.</S>
    <S>It was implemented in the IE module of FACILE, a EU project for multilingual text classification and IE.</S>
