    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper, we propose a novel Cooperative Model for natural language understanding in a dialogue system.</S>
    <S>We build this based on both Finite State Model (FSM) and Statistical Learning Model (SLM).</S>
    <S>FSM provides two strategies for language understanding and have a high accuracy but little robustness and flexibility.</S>
    <S>Statistical approach is much more robust but less accurate.</S>
    <S>Cooperative Model incorporates all the three strategies together and thus can suppress all the shortcomings of different strategies and has all the advantages of the three strategies.</S>
