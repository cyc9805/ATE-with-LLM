    <S>Being able to predict the placement of contrastive accent is essential for the assignment of correct accentuation patterns in spoken language generation.</S>
    <S>I discuss two approaches to the generation of contrastive accent and propose an alternative method that is feasible and computationally attractive in data-to-speech systems.</S>
