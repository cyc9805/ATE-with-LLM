  <Title>A LOGICAL SEMANTICS FOR FEATURE STRUCTURES</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Unification-based grammar formalisms use structures containing sets of features to describe linguistic objects.</S>
    <S>Although computational algorithms for unification of feature structures have been worked out in experimental research, these algorithms become quite complicated, and a more precise description of feature structures is desirable.</S>
    <S>We have developed a model in which descriptions of feature structures can be regarded as logical formulas, and interpreted by sets of directed graphs which satisfy them.</S>
    <S>These graphs are, in fact, transition graphs for a special type of deterministic finite automaton.</S>
    <S>This semantics for feature structures extends the ideas of Pereira and Shieber [11], by providing an interpretation for values which are specified by disjunctions and path values embedded within disjunctions.</S>
    <S>Our interpretation differs from that of Pereira and Shieber by using a logical model in place of a denotational semantics.</S>
    <S>This logical model yields a calculus of equivalences, which can be used to simplify formulas.</S>
    <S>Unification is attractive, because of its generality, but it is often computationally inefficient.</S>
    <S>Our model allows a careful examination of the computational complexity of unification.</S>
    <S>We have shown that the consistency problem for formulas with disjunctive values is NP-complete.</S>
    <S>To deal with this complexity, we describe how disjunctive values can be specified in a way which delays expansion to disjunctive normal form.</S>
