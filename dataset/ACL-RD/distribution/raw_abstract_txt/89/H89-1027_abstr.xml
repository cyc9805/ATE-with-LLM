  <Title>THE MIT SUMMIT SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM: A PROGRESS REPORT</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>Recently, we initiated a project to develop a phonetically-based spoken language understanding system called SUMMIT.</S>
    <S>In contrast to many of the past efforts that make use of heuristic rules whose development requires intense knowledge engineering, our approach attempts to express the speech knowledge within a formal framework using well-defined mathematical tools.</S>
    <S>In our system, features and decision strategies are discovered and trained automatically, using a large body of speech data.</S>
    <S>This paper describes the system, and documents its current performance.</S>
