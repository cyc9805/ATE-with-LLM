  <Title>An Improved Redundancy Elimination Algorithm for Underspecified Representations</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We present an efficient algorithm for the redundancy elimination problem: Given an underspecified semantic representation (USR) of a scope ambiguity, compute an USR with fewer mutually equivalent readings.</S>
    <S>The algorithm operates on underspecified chart representations which are derived from dominance graphs; it can be applied to the USRs computed by large-scale grammars.</S>
    <S>We evaluate the algorithm on a corpus, and show that it reduces the degree of ambiguity significantly while taking negligible runtime.</S>
