    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We apply a decision tree based approach to pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue.</S>
    <S>Our system deals with pronouns with NP- and non-NP-antecedents.</S>
    <S>We present a set of features designed for pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue and determine the most promising features.</S>
    <S>We evaluate the system on twenty Switchboard dialogues and show that it compares well to Byron's (2002) manually tuned system.</S>
