THE ACL RD-TEC 2.0: A dataset for evaluation of term and entity recognition in computational linguistics


#What this repository contains?

The dataset is organised in the following directories:
* readme.txt: this file.
* /documents: contains the annotation guidelines as well as a paper that describe the annotation process.
* /annotations_during_guideline_dev: Materials related to the development of guidelines; this includes the annotated files during this process as well as the guidelines used by the annotators. 
* /annoitation_files: contains all annotated files; these files are grouped per annotator; for ease of use, those annotations that are annotated by by both annotators are collected and again presented in the directory double_annotated_files. 
* /pos_tagged_vertical_files: Annotation files converted to the familiar vertical format (i.e., a token or annotation tag per line). These files contain automatically obtained part-of-speech tagged  and lemmas using the Stanford CoreNLP library. 
* /raw_abstract_txt: Contains abstract text files, segmented and corrected for OCR errors. These files do not contain any annotation.
* /licenses: license files.


#History

ACL RD-TEC 2.0 is developed by Dr. Anne-Kathrin Schumann and Behrang QasemiZadeh. The dataset is developed as the second version of ACL RD-TEC in order to provide annotation of terms in context.
