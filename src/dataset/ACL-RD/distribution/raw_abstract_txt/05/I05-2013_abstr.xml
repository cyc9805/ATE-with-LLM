  <Title>Automatic recognition of French expletive pronoun occurrences</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We present a tool, called ILIMP, which takes as input a raw text in French and produces as output the same text in which every occurrence of the pronoun il is tagged either with tag [ANA] for anaphoric or [IMP] for impersonal or expletive.</S>
    <S>This tool is therefore designed to distinguish between the anaphoric occurrences of il, for which an anaphora resolution system has to look for an antecedent, and the expletive occurrences of this pronoun, for which it does not make sense to look for an antecedent.</S>
    <S>The precision rate for ILIMP is 97,5%.</S>
    <S>The few errors are analyzed in detail.</S>
    <S>Other tasks using the method developed for ILIMP are described briefly, as well as the use of ILIMP in a modular syntactic analysis system.</S>
