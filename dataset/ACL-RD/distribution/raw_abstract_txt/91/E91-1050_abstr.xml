    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Unification is often the appropriate method for expressing relations between representations in the form of feature structures; however, there are circumstances in which a different approach is desirable.</S>
    <S>A declarative formalism is presented which permits direct mappings of one feature structure into another, and illustrative examples are given of its application to areas of current interest.</S>
