  <Title>Using Machine Translation Evaluation Techniques to Determine Sentence-level Semantic Equivalence</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>The task of machine translation (MT) evaluation is closely related to the task of sentence-level semantic equivalence classification.</S>
    <S>This paper investigates the utility of applying standard MT evaluation methods (BLEU, NIST, WER and PER) to building classifiers to predict semantic equivalence and entailment.</S>
    <S>We also introduce a novel classification method based on PER which leverages part of speech information of the words contributing to the word matches and non-matches in the sentence.</S>
    <S>Our results show that MT evaluation techniques are able to produce useful features for paraphrase classification and to a lesser extent entailment.</S>
    <S>Our technique gives a substantial improvement in paraphrase classification accuracy over all of the other models used in the experiments.</S>
