  <Title>Fragments of a Theory of Human Plausible Reasoning</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>The paper outlines a computational theory of human plausible reasoning constructed from analysis of people's answers to everyday questions.</S>
    <S>Like logic, the theory is expressed in a content-independent formalism.</S>
    <S>Unlike logic, the theory specifies how different information in memory affects the certainty of the conclusions drawn.</S>
    <S>The theory consists of a dimensionalized space of different inference types and their certainty conditions, including a variety of meta-inference types where the inference depends on the person's knowledge about his own knowledge.</S>
    <S>The protocols from people's answers to questions are analyzed in terms of the different inference types.</S>
    <S>The paper also discusses how memory is structured in multiple ways to support the different inference types, and how the information found in memory determines which inference types are triggered.</S>
