  <Title>An Efficient Easily Adaptable System for Interpreting Natural Language Queries</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle></SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper gives an overall account of a prototype natural language question answering system, called Chat-80.</S>
    <S>Chat-80 has been designed to be both efficient and easily adaptable to a variety of applications.</S>
    <S>The system is implemented entirely in Prolog, a programming language based on logic.</S>
    <S>With the aid of a logic-based grammar formalism called extraposition grammars, Chat-80 translates English questions into the Prolog subset of logic.</S>
    <S>The resulting logical expression is then transformed by a planning algorithm into efficient Prolog, cf. query optimisation in a relational database.</S>
    <S>Finally, the Prolog form is executed to yield the answer.</S>
