    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Statistical machine translation (SMT) is currently one of the hot spots in natural language processing.</S>
    <S>Over the last few years dramatic improvements have been made, and a number of comparative evaluations have shown, that SMT gives competitive results to rule-based translation systems, requiring significantly less development time.</S>
    <S>This is particularly important when building translation systems for new language pairs or new domains.</S>
    <S>This workshop is intended to give an introduction to statistical machine translation with a focus on practical considerations.</S>
    <S>Participants should be able, after attending this workshop, to set out building an SMT system themselves and achieving good baseline results in a short time.</S>
    <S>The tutorial will cover the basics of SMT:</S>
    <S>Theory will be put into practice.</S>
    <S>STTK, a statistical machine translation tool kit, will be introduced and used to build a working translation system.</S>
    <S>STTK has been developed by the presenter and co-workers over a number of years and is currently used as the basis of CMU's SMT system.</S>
    <S>It has also successfully been coupled with rule-based and example based machine translation modules to build a multi engine machine translation system.</S>
    <S>The source code of the tool kit will be made available.</S>
