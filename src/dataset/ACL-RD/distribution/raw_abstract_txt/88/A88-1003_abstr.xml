  <Title>An Architecture for Anaphora Resolution</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper, we describe the pronominal anaphora resolution module of Lucy, a portable English understanding system.</S>
    <S>The design of this module was motivated by the observation that, although there exist many theories of anaphora resolution, no one of these theories is complete.</S>
    <S>Thus we have implemented a blackboard-like architecture in which individual partial theories can be encoded as separate modules that can interact to propose candidate antecedents and to evaluate each other's proposals.</S>
