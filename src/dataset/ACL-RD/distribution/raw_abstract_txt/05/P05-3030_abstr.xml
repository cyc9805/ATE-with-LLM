    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We propose a method of organizing reading materials for vocabulary learning.</S>
    <S>It enables us to select a concise set of reading texts (from a target corpus) that contains all the target vocabulary to be learned.</S>
    <S>We used a specialized vocabulary for an English certification test as the target vocabulary and used English Wikipedia, a free-content encyclopedia, as the target corpus.</S>
    <S>The organized reading materials would enable learners not only to study the target vocabulary efficiently but also to gain a variety of knowledge through reading.</S>
    <S>The reading materials are available on our web site.</S>
