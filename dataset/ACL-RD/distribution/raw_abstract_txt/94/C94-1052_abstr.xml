    <S>This paper describes the enhancements made, within a unification framework, based on typed feature structures, in order to support linking of lexical entries to their translation equivalents.</S>
    <S>To help this task we have developed an interactive environment: TGE.</S>
    <S>Several experiments, corresponding to rather closed semantic domains, have been developed in order to generate lexical cross-relations between English and Spanish.</S>
