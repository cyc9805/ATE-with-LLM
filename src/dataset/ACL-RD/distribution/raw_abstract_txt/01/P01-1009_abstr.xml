    <S>This paper presents a formal analysis for a large class of words called alternative markers, which includes other (than), such (as), and besides.</S>
    <S>These words appear frequently enough in dialog to warrant serious attention, yet present natural language search engines perform poorly on queries containing them.</S>
    <S>I show that the performance of a search engine can be improved dramatically by incorporating an approximation of the formal analysis that is compatible with the search engine's operational semantics.</S>
    <S>The value of this approach is that as the operational semantics of natural language applications improve, even larger improvements are possible.</S>
