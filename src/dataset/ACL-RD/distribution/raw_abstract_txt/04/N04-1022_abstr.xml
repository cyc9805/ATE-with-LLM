    <S>We present Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding for statistical machine translation.</S>
    <S>This statistical approach aims to minimize expected loss of translation errors under loss functions that measure translation performance.</S>
    <S>We describe a hierarchy of loss functions that incorporate different levels of linguistic information from word strings, word-to-word alignments from an MT system, and syntactic structure from parse-trees of source and target language sentences.</S>
    <S>We report the performance of the MBR decoders on a Chinese-to-English translation task.</S>
    <S>Our results show that MBR decoding can be used to tune statistical MT performance for specific loss functions.</S>
