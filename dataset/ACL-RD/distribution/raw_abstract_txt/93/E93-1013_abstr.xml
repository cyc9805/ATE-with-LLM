    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Semantic theories of natural language associate meanings with utterances by providing meanings for lexical items and rules for determining the meaning of larger units given the meanings of their parts.</S>
    <S>Traditionally, meanings are combined via function composition, which works well when constituent structure trees are used to guide semantic composition.</S>
    <S>More recently, the functional structure of LFG has been used to provide the syntactic information necessary for constraining derivations of meaning in a cross-linguistically uniform format.</S>
    <S>It has been difficult, however, to reconcile this approach with the combination of meanings by function composition.</S>
    <S>In contrast to compositional approaches, we present a deductive approach to assembling meanings, based on reasoning with constraints, which meshes well with the unordered nature of information in the functional structure.</S>
    <S>Our use of linear logic as a 'glue' for assembling meanings also allows for a coherent treatment of modification as well as of the LFG requirements of completeness and coherence.</S>
