    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper we present our recent work on harvesting English-Chinese bitexts of the laws of Hong Kong from the Web and aligning them to the subparagraph level via utilizing the numbering system in the legal text hierarchy.</S>
    <S>Basic methodology and practical techniques are reported in detail.</S>
    <S>The resultant bilingual corpus, 10.4M English words and 18.3M Chinese characters, is an authoritative and comprehensive text collection covering the specific and special domain of HK laws.</S>
    <S>It is particularly valuable to empirical MT research.</S>
    <S>This piece of work has also laid a foundation for exploring and harvesting English-Chinese bitexts in a larger volume from the Web.</S>
