  <Title>Paraphrasing with Bilingual Parallel Corpora</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Previous work has used monolingual parallel corpora to extract and generate paraphrases.</S>
    <S>We show that this task can be done using bilingual parallel corpora, a much more commonly available resource.</S>
    <S>Using alignment techniques from phrase-based statistical machine translation, we show how paraphrases in one language can be identified using a phrase in another language as a pivot.</S>
    <S>We define a paraphrase probability that allows paraphrases extracted from a bilingual parallel corpus to be ranked using translation probabilities, and show how it can be refined to take contextual information into account.</S>
    <S>We evaluate our paraphrase extraction and ranking methods using a set of manual word alignments, and contrast the quality with paraphrases extracted from automatic alignments.</S>
