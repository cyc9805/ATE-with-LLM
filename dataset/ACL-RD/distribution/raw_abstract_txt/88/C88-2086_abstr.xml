    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>/Soames 1979/ provides some counterexamples to the theory of natural language presuppositions that is presented in /Gazdar 1979/.</S>
    <S>/Soames 1982/ provides a theory which explains these counterexamples.</S>
    <S>/Mercer 1987/ rejects the solution found in /Soames 1982/ leaving these counterexamples unexplained.</S>
    <S>By reappraising these insightful counterexamples, the inferential theory for natural language presuppositions described in /Mercer 1987, 1988/ gives a simple and straightforward explanation for the presuppositional nature of these sentences.</S>
