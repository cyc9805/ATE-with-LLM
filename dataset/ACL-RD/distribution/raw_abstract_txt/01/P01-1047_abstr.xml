  <Title>Extending Lambek grammars: a logical account of minimalist grammars</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We provide a logical definition of Minimalist grammars, that are Stabler's formalization of Chomsky's minimalist program.</S>
    <S>Our logical definition leads to a neat relation to categorial grammar, (yielding a treatment of Montague semantics), a parsing-as-deduction in a resource sensitive logic, and a learning algorithm from structured data (based on a typing-algorithm and type-unification).</S>
    <S>Here we emphasize the connection to Montague semantics which can be viewed as a formal computation of the logical form.</S>
