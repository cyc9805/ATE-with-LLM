  <Title>BLEU in characters: towards automatic MT evaluation in languages without word delimiters</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Automatic evaluation metrics for Machine Translation (MT) systems, such as BLEU or NIST, are now well established.</S>
    <S>Yet, they are scarcely used for the assessment of language pairs like English-Chinese or English-Japanese, because of the word segmentation problem.</S>
    <S>This study establishes the equivalence between the standard use of BLEU in word n-grams and its application at the character level.</S>
    <S>The use of BLEU at the character level eliminates the word segmentation problem: it makes it possible to directly compare commercial systems outputting unsegmented texts with, for instance, statistical MT systems which usually segment their outputs.</S>
