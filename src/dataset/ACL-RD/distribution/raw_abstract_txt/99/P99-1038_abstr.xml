    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We propose a formal system for representing the available readings of sentences displaying quantifier scope ambiguity, in which partial scopes may be expressed.</S>
    <S>We show that using a theory of scope availability based upon the function-argument structure of a sentence allows a deterministic, polynomial time test for the availability of a reading, while solving the same problem within theories based on the well-formedness of sentences in the meaning language has been shown to be NP-hard.</S>
