    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Japanese texts frequently suffer from the homophone errors caused by the KANA-KANJI conversion needed to input the text.</S>
    <S>It is critical, therefore, for Japanese revision support systems to detect and to correct homophone errors.</S>
    <S>This paper proposes a method for detecting and correcting Japanese homophone errors in compound nouns.</S>
    <S>This method can not only detect Japanese homophone errors in compound nouns, but also can find the correct candidates for the detected errors automatically.</S>
    <S>Finding the correct candidates is one superiority of this method over existing methods.</S>
    <S>The basic idea of this method is that a compound noun component places some restrictions on the semantic categories of the adjoining words.</S>
    <S>The method accurately determines that a homophone is misused in a compound noun if one or both of its neighbors is not a member of the semantic set defined by the homophone.</S>
    <S>Also, the method successfully indicates the correct candidates for the detected homophone errors.</S>
