    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We introduce a new interactive corpus exploration tool called InfoMagnets.</S>
    <S>InfoMagnets aims at making exploratory corpus analysis accessible to researchers who are not experts in text mining.</S>
    <S>As evidence of its usefulness and usability, it has been used successfully in a research context to uncover relationships between language and behavioral patterns in two distinct domains: tutorial dialogue (Kumar et al., submitted) and on-line communities (Arguello et al., 2006).</S>
    <S>As an educational tool, it has been used as part of a unit on protocol analysis in an Educational Research Methods course.</S>
