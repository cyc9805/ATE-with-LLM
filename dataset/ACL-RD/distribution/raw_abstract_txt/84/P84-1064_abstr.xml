  <Title>A COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF DISPOSITIONS</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>Informally, a disposition is a proposition which is preponderantly, but not necessarily always, true.</S>
    <S>For example, birds can fly is a disposition, as are the propositions Swedes are blond and Spaniards are dark.</S>
    <S>An idea which underlies the theory described in this paper is that a disposition may be viewed as a proposition with implicit fuzzy quantifiers which are approximations to all and always, e.g., almost all, almost always, most, frequently, etc.</S>
    <S>For example, birds can fly may be interpreted as the result of suppressing the fuzzy quantifier most in the proposition most birds can fly.</S>
    <S>Similarly, young men like young women may be read as most young men like mostly young women.</S>
    <S>The process of transforming a disposition into a proposition is referred to as explicitation or restoration.</S>
    <S>Explicitation sets the stage for representing the meaning of a proposition through the use of test-score semantics (Zadeh, 1978, 1982).</S>
    <S>In this approach to semantics, the meaning of a proposition, p, is represented as a procedure which tests, scores and aggregates the elastic constraints which are induced by p.</S>
    <S>The paper closes with a description of an approach to reasoning with dispositions which is based on the concept of a fuzzy syllogism.</S>
    <S>Syllogistic reasoning with dispositions has an important bearing on commonsense reasoning as well as on the management of uncertainty in expert systems.</S>
    <S>As a simple application of the techniques described in this paper, we formulate a definition of typicality -- a concept which plays an important role in human cognition and is of relevance to default reasoning.</S>
