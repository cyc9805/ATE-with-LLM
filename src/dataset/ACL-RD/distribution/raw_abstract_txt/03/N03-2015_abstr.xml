    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We describe a simple unsupervised technique for learning morphology by identifying hubs in an automaton.</S>
    <S>For our purposes, a hub is a node in a graph with in-degree greater than one and out-degree greater than one.</S>
    <S>We create a word-trie, transform it into a minimal DFA, then identify hubs.</S>
    <S>Those hubs mark the boundary between root and suffix, achieving similar performance to more complex mixtures of techniques.</S>
