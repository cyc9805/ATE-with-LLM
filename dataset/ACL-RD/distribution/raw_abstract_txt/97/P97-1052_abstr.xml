  <Title>On Interpreting F-Structures as UDRSs</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We describe a method for interpreting abstract flat syntactic representations, LFG f-structures, as underspecified semantic representations, here Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (UDRSs).</S>
    <S>The method establishes a one-to-one correspondence between subsets of the LFG and UDRS formalisms.</S>
    <S>It provides a model theoretic interpretation and an inferential component which operates directly on underspecified representations for f-structures through the translation images of f-structures as UDRSs.</S>
