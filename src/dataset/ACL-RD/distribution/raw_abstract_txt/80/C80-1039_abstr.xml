    <SectionTitle></SectionTitle>
    <S>In order to meet the needs of a publication of papers in English, many systems to run off texts have been developed.</S>
    <S>In this paper, we report a system FROFF which can make a fair copy of not only texts but also graphs and tables indispensable to our papers.</S>
    <S>Its selection of fonts, specification of character size are dynamically changeable, and the typing location can be also changed in lateral or longitudinal directions.</S>
    <S>Each character has its own width and a line length is counted by the sum of each character.</S>
    <S>By using commands or rules which are defined to facilitate the construction of format expected or some mathematical expressions, elaborate and pretty documents can be successfully obtained.</S>
