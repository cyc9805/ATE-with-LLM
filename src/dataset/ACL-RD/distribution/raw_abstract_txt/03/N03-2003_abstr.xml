    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Sources of training data suitable for language modeling of conversational speech are limited.</S>
    <S>In this paper, we show how training data can be supplemented with text from the web filtered to match the style and/or topic of the target recognition task, but also that it is possible to get bigger performance gains from the data by using class-dependent interpolation of N-grams.</S>
