  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper presents the results of automatically inducing a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) lexicon from a Turkish dependency treebank.</S>
    <S>The fact that Turkish is an agglutinating free word-order language presents a challenge for language theories.</S>
    <S>We explored possible ways to obtain a compact lexicon, consistent with CCG principles, from a treebank which is an order of magnitude smaller than Penn WSJ.</S>
