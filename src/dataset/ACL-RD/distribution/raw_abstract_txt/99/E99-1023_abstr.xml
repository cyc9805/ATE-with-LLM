    <S>Dividing sentences in chunks of words is a useful preprocessing step for parsing, information extraction and information retrieval.</S>
    <S>(Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) have introduced a convenient data representation for chunking by converting it to a tagging task.</S>
    <S>In this paper we will examine seven different data representations for the problem of recognizing noun phrase chunks.</S>
    <S>We will show that the the data representation choice has a minor influence on chunking performance.</S>
    <S>However, equipped with the most suitable data representation, our memory-based learning chunker was able to improve the best published chunking results for a standard data set.</S>
