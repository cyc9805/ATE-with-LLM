    <S>This paper describes the LT NSL system (McKelvie et al, 1996), an architecture for writing corpus processing tools.</S>
    <S>This system is then compared with two other systems which address similar issues, the GATE system (Cunningham et al, 1995) and the IMS Corpus Workbench (Christ, 1994).</S>
    <S>In particular we address the advantages and disadvantages of an SGML approach compared with a non-SGML database approach.</S>
