    <SectionTitle>ABSTRACT</SectionTitle>
    <S>A research program is described in which a particular representational format for meaning is tested as broadly as possible.</S>
    <S>In this format, developed by the LNR research group at The University of California at San Diego, verbs are represented as interconnected sets of subpredicates.</S>
    <S>These subpredicates may be thought of as the almost inevitable inferences that a listener makes when a verb is used in a sentence.</S>
    <S>They confer a meaning structure on the sentence in which the verb is used.</S>
