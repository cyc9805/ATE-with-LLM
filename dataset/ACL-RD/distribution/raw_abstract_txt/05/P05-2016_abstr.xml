    <S>We present a Czech-English statistical machine translation system which performs tree-to-tree translation of dependency structures.</S>
    <S>The only bilingual resource required is a sentence-aligned parallel corpus.</S>
    <S>All other resources are monolingual.</S>
    <S>We also refer to an evaluation method and plan to compare our system's output with a benchmark system.</S>
