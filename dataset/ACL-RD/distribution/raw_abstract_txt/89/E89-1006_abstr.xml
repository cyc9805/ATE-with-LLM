  <Title>TENSES AS ANAPHORA</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>A proposal to deal with French tenses in the framework of Discourse Representation Theory is presented, as it has been implemented for a fragment at the IMS.</S>
    <S>It is based on the theory of tenses of H. Kamp and Ch. Rohrer.</S>
    <S>Instead of using operators to express the meaning of the tenses the Reichenbachian point of view is adopted and refined such that the impact of the tenses with respect to the meaning of the text is understood as contribution to the integration of the events of a sentence in the event structure of the preceeding text.</S>
    <S>Thereby a system of relevant times provided by the preceeding text and by the temporal adverbials of the sentence being processed is used.</S>
    <S>This system consists of one or more reference times and temporal perspective times, the speech time and the location time.</S>
    <S>The special interest of our proposal is to establish a plausible choice of anchors for the new event out of the system of relevant times and to update this system of temporal coordinates correctly.</S>
    <S>The problem of choice is largely neglected in the literature.</S>
    <S>In opposition to the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the exact meaning of the tenses is fixed by the resolution component and not in the process of syntactic analysis.</S>
