    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>The JAVELIN system integrates a flexible, planning-based architecture with a variety of language processing modules to provide an open-domain question answering capability on free text.</S>
    <S>The demonstration will focus on how JAVELIN processes questions and retrieves the most likely answer candidates from the given text corpus.</S>
    <S>The operation of the system will be explained in depth through browsing the repository of data objects created by the system during each question answering session.</S>
