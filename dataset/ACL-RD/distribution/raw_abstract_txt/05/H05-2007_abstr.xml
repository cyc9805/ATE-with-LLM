    <S>We describe a method for identifying systematic patterns in translation data using part-of-speech tag sequences.</S>
    <S>We incorporate this analysis into a diagnostic tool intended for developers of machine translation systems, and demonstrate how our application can be used by developers to explore patterns in machine translation output.</S>
