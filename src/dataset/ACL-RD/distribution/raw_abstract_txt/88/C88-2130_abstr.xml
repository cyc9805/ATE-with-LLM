    <S>We have developed a computational model of the process of describing the layout of an apartment or house, a much-studied discourse task first characterized linguistically by Linde (1974).</S>
    <S>The model is embodied in a program, APT, that can reproduce segments of actual tape-recorded descriptions, using organizational and discourse strategies derived through analysis of our corpus.</S>
