    <S>We propose a new phrase-based translation model and decoding algorithm that enables us to evaluate and compare several, previously proposed phrase-based translation models.</S>
    <S>Within our framework, we carry out a large number of experiments to understand better and explain why phrase-based models outperform word-based models.</S>
    <S>Our empirical results, which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple means: heuristic learning of phrase translations from word-based alignments and lexical weighting of phrase translations.</S>
    <S>Surprisingly, learning phrases longer than three words and learning phrases from high-accuracy word-level alignment models does not have a strong impact on performance.</S>
    <S>Learning only syntactically motivated phrases degrades the performance of our systems.</S>
