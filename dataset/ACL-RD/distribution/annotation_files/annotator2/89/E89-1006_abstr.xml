Kamp and Ch. Rohrer.</S>    <S>Instead of using <term class="other">operators</term> to express the <term class="other">meaning</term> of the <term class="other">tenses</term> the Reichenbachian point of view is adopted and refined such that the impact of the <term class="other">tenses</term> with respect to the <term class="other">meaning</term> of the text is understood as contribution to the integration of the <term class="other">events</term> of a <term class="other">sentence</term> in the <term class="other">event structure</term> of the preceeding text.</S>    <S>Thereby a system of <term class="other">relevant times</term> provided by the preceeding text and by the <term class="other">temporal adverbials</term> of the <term class="other">sentence</term> being processed is used.</S>    <S>This system consists of one or more <term class="other">reference times</term> and <term class="other">temporal perspective times</term>, the <term class="other">speech time</term> and the <term class="other">location time</term>.</S>    <S>The special interest of our proposal is to establish a plausible choice of <term class="other">anchors</term> for the new <term class="other">event</term> out of the system of <term class="other">relevant times</term> and to update this system of <term class="other">temporal coordinates</term> correctly.</S>    <S>The problem of choice is largely neglected in the literature.</S>    <S>In opposition to the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the exact meaning of the <term class="other">tenses</term> is fixed by the <term class="other">resolution component</term> and not in the process of <term class="tech">syntactic analysis</term>.</S>  </Section></Paper>
