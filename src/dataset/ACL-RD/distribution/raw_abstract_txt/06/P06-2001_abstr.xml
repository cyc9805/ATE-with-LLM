    <S>In this paper, we describe the research using machine learning techniques to build a comma checker to be integrated in a grammar checker for Basque.</S>
    <S>After several experiments, and trained with a little corpus of 100,000 words, the system guesses correctly not placing commas with a precision of 96% and a recall of 98%.</S>
    <S>It also gets a precision of 70% and a recall of 49% in the task of placing commas.</S>
    <S>Finally, we have shown that these results can be improved using a bigger and a more homogeneous corpus to train, that is, a bigger corpus written by one unique author.</S>
