    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper describes a domain independent strategy for the multimedia articulation of answers elicited by a natural language interface to database query applications.</S>
    <S>Multimedia answers include videodisc images and heuristically-produced complete sentences in text or text-to-speech form.</S>
    <S>Deictic reference and feedback about the discourse are enabled.</S>
    <S>The interface thus presents the application as cooperative and conversational.</S>
