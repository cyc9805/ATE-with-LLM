  <Title>Compilation of HPSG to TAG</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We present an implemented compilation algorithm that translates HPSG into lexicalized feature-based TAG, relating concepts of the two theories.</S>
    <S>While HPSG has a more elaborated principle-based theory of possible phrase structures, TAG provides the means to represent lexicalized structures more explicitly.</S>
    <S>Our objectives are met by giving clear definitions that determine the projection of structures from the lexicon, and identify maximal projections, auxiliary trees and foot nodes.</S>
