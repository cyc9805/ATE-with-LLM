  <Title>Modeling Local Coherence: An Entity-based Approach</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper considers the problem of automatic assessment of local coherence.</S>
    <S>We present a novel entity-based representation of discourse which is inspired by Centering Theory and can be computed automatically from raw text.</S>
    <S>We view coherence assessment as a ranking learning problem and show that the proposed discourse representation supports the effective learning of a ranking function.</S>
    <S>Our experiments demonstrate that the induced model achieves significantly higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art coherence model.</S>
