    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>The transfer phase in machine translation (MT) systems has been considered to be more complicated than analysis and generation, since it is inherently a conglomeration of individual lexical rules.</S>
    <S>Currently some attempts are being made to use case-based reasoning in machine translation, that is, to make decisions on the basis of translation examples at appropriate pints in MT.</S>
    <S>This paper proposes a new type of transfer system, called a Similarity-driven Transfer System (SimTran), for use in such case-based MT (CBMT).</S>
