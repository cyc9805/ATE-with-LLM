    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>We propose a new method of classifying documents into categories.</S>
    <S>We define for each category a finite mixture model based on soft clustering of words.</S>
    <S>We treat the problem of classifying documents as that of conducting statistical hypothesis testing over finite mixture models, and employ the EM algorithm to efficiently estimate parameters in a finite mixture model.</S>
    <S>Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing methods.</S>
