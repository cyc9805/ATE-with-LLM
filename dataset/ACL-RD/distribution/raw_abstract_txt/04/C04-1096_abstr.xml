  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>Past work of generating referring expressions mainly utilized attributes of objects and binary relations between objects.</S>
    <S>However, such an approach does not work well when there is no distinctive attribute among objects.</S>
    <S>To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a method utilizing the perceptual groups of objects and n-ary relations among them.</S>
    <S>The key is to identify groups of objects that are naturally recognized by humans.</S>
    <S>We conducted psychological experiments with 42 subjects to collect referring expressions in such situations, and built a generation algorithm based on the results.</S>
    <S>The evaluation using another 23 subjects showed that the proposed method could effectively generate proper referring expressions.</S>
