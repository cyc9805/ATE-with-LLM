  <Title>Dynamic Nonlocal Language Modeling via Hierarchical Topic-Based Adaptation</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>This paper presents a novel method of generating and applying hierarchical, dynamic topic-based language models.</S>
    <S>It proposes and evaluates new cluster generation, hierarchical smoothing and adaptive topic-probability estimation techniques.</S>
    <S>These combined models help capture long-distance lexical dependencies.</S>
    <S>Experiments on the Broadcast News corpus show significant improvement in perplexity (10.5% overall and 33.5% on target vocabulary).</S>
