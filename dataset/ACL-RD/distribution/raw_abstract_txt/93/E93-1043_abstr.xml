  <Title>Coping With Derivation in a Morphological Component</Title>
  <Section>
    <SectionTitle>Abstract</SectionTitle>
    <S>In this paper a morphological component with a limited capability to automatically interpret (and generate) derived words is presented.</S>
    <S>The system combines an extended two-level morphology \[Trost, 1991a; Trost, 1991b\] with a feature-based word grammar building on a hierarchical lexicon.</S>
    <S>Polymorphemic stems not explicitly stored in the lexicon are given a compositional interpretation.</S>
    <S>That way the system allows to minimize redundancy in the lexicon because derived words that are transparent need not to be stored explicitly.</S>
    <S>Also, words formed ad-hoc can be recognized correctly.</S>
    <S>The system is implemented in Common Lisp and has been tested on examples from German derivation.</S>
